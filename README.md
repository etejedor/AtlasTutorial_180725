## Objectives
During this session, you will see in action the concepts we discussed during the presentation. In particular, you will perform an "analysis" of an open dataset of the CMS experiment.

The tool you will be using is [RDataFrame](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDataFrame.html). We provided for you two notebooks where you will be able to complete a skeleton already prepared for you. One notebook is in Python, the other one in C++: feel free to decide to start with the one you prefer. 

We provide also solutions: our proposal to solve the exercises we provide. Try to look at them only when the time is up!

**Warning**: remember to configure your SWAN session with the "Bleeding Edge" software stack, which includes the 6.14/00 ROOT release.

## Running a Notebook Cell
In order to run a notebook cell, the combination of keys to press is *shift+enter*, in case you are not familiar with this interface!
